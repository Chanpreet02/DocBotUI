# DocBot Chatbot UI with Voice Input

Welcome to **DocBot**, a simple and interactive chatbot built using **Flutter**. This project demonstrates the integration of a microphone feature that allows users to input messages by speaking, making the chatbot interaction more intuitive and dynamic.

## Features

- **Interactive Chatbot UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface where the chatbot's logo initially appears. Upon sending a message, the logo disappears, and the message is displayed.
- **Voice Input**: Speak directly into your deviceâ€™s microphone to input text. The spoken words are captured and automatically entered into the message field, eliminating the need to type.
- **Hardcoded Response**: After a 3-second delay, the chatbot responds with a hardcoded message: _"Ok, this is accepted"_.
- **Flutter-based**: Built using **Flutter** for cross-platform compatibility on both Android and iOS devices.
